Usage
-----

After pulling down the source code, run the application with either the default Sinatra way or use Shotgun.

**Sinatra:**

    $ ruby app.rb

Visit http://127.0.0.1:4567/ in your browser.

**Shotgun:**

    $ shotgun app.rb

Visit http://127.0.0.1:9393/ in your browser.

The index page lists some next steps to take but if you're in a hurry just delete the `public/blankslate` folder and add your own content to the views.

**TODO**

* Ask for permission to use background image
* Evenly distribute resource links in the footer
* Describe the best way to pull down code
